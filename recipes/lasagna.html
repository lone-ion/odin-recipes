<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy
filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of
small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty
garlic bread.</p>
